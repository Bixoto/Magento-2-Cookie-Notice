# Magento 2 Cookie Notice

Magento 2 Cookie Notice extension lets admins display a cookie notice in the Magento 2 frontend.

The original code was developed by [Meetanshi][] but the [repository][] appears to have been abandoned in 2019. However,
Meetanshi continues to publish updates of the module and still distributes the code under the dual license OSL-3.0 /
AFL-3.0.

The present repository contains the latest code from upstream as well as some additional translation files:
- es_ES
- pt_BR (by [Mauricio Antonio da Silva](https://github.com/MeetanshiInc/Magento-2-Cookie-Notice/pull/3))
